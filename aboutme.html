<span class="fa fa-code about-icon"></span>
I enjoy competing at <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/nizamuddin/">Kaggle</a> & other data science competitions, testing & honing my skills; I have worked across a wide range of problems in these competitions, from predictive modeling, computer vision to natural language processing. 
In the past and occasionaly now, I compete in coding challenges on platforms like <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/typhoon0">HackerRank</a> & Project Euler to improve my coding skills.  
<br>
I am an avid learner, learning things from first principles: taking apart the concepts one by one until there is no more but the indivisible atomic principles.
