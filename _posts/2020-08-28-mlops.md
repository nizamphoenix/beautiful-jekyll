Today almost all businesses are integrating AI in their systems to gain leverage and beating others to the market. The ones who adapt and adopt appropriately, seamlessly(automation) implementing and delivering solutions with minimal human intervention are establishing themselves in the market. Machine learning software systems that identify patterns in data to make informed decisions for solving complex real-world problems are becoming pivotal in transforming industries to delivering value. Therefore, many businesses are investing in their data science teams and ML capabilities to develop predictive models that can deliver business value to their users.  

**MLOps** is an ML engineering culture and practice that aims at unifying ML system development (Dev) and ML system operation (Ops). Employing MLOps means to promote automation of ML systems from construction to integration to testing to deployment and infrastructure management. The real challenge with ML system isn't building an ML model, the challenge is building an integrated ML system and to continuously operate it in production.

In the above diagram, the ML system is composed of configuration, automation, data collection, data verification, testing and debugging, resource management, model analysis, process and metadata management, serving infrastructure, and monitoring. Such sophisticated software systems are *developed* and *operated* with MLOps(DevOps+ML) principles.
